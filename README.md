# Seolhwa's Xmonad Desktop
This is the repository for all of the dotfiles and theme/skin files I use on my linux desktop. It has:
- xmonad
- xmobar
- my custom rofi and winamp/audacious skins/themes
- a list of links to all of the system themes, fonts, and icons I use
- a list of all the programs that I need on a daily basis 
- kitty
- emacs
- picom
- dunst
- my .profile
- my .bashrc

I put all of this here so I can easily retrieve or share my desktop stuff, mainly when I need to reinstall it all.
