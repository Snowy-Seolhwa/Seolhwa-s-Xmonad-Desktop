# Seolhwa's Xmonad Desktop
This is the repository for all of the dotfiles and theme/skin files I use on my linux desktop. It has:
- xmonad
- xmobar
- my custom rofi theme
- a list of links to all of the system themes, fonts, and icons I use
- a list of all the programs that I need on a daily basis 
- kitty
- emacs
- picom
- dunst
- my .profile
- my .bashrc

I put all of this here so I can easily retrieve or share my desktop stuff, mainly when I need to reinstall it all. 
Feel free to use any of this however you want, my Xmonad.hs is based on the Xmonad.org config tutorial but heavily edited.

Some of the features of my Xmonad include:
- beginner friendly comments and explanations of basically every line
- ewmh fullscreen capability (so fullscreen programs don't lock up, crash, or malfunction)
- 6 different tiling algorithms with additional helpful layouts
- 2D window and screen navigation using arrow keys
- named scratchpads
- some keybindings for thinkpad t530 keys
- output to Xmobar for active and focused workspaces, current tiling algorithm, and a marker for active scratchpads
- various settings to launch important programs like rofi, dunst, scrot, feh, and xscreensaver
- a minimalistic, clean, and techy aesthetic
